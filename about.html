                <p>An area of ancient written culture from the 1st millennium BCE, the Ethiopian
                    highlands have been home to a complex literary tradition (predominantly in
                    Gǝʿǝz) that has no parallel in sub-Saharan Africa. Its emergence was determined
                    by late antique culture (Byzantium including Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and the
                    Red Sea), Mediterranean cultural encounters, and the African background. </p>
                <p> The earliest known texts were translations from Greek, later works were adopted
                    from Christian Arabic (esp. Copto-Arabic) literary tradition, in addition to a
                    rich local written production. The complexity of literary history is fully
                    reflected in the changes in grammar, lexicon and stylistic means of the Gǝʿǝz
                    language.</p>

                    project funded within the framework of the Academies’ Programme (coordinated by
                    the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities) under survey of
                    the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Hamburg. The funding will be provided for 25
                    years, from 2016–2040. The project is hosted by the Hiob Ludolf Centre for
                    Ethiopian Studies at the Universität Hamburg. It aims at creating a virtual
                    research environment that shall manage complex data related to predominantly
                    Christian manuscript tradition of the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands.</p>

        <h2>About this application</h2>
        <p>This application, built in eXist-db uses basic tecniques to display data from the
            digitization process of the Lexicon linguae Aethiopicae of August Dillmann. It is
            deployed at the moment only for registered users with the relevant data at the
            Universität Hamburg. </p>
        <h3>Preprocessing</h3> 
       <p> Heavy preprocessing of data has been carried out with regex in Oxygen XML Editor
           to encode the text starting from a txt version that is the outcome of a work of many years, started by Alessandro Bausi, with the help of Andreas Ellwardt, Irene Roticiani, and others. The txt used as basis for this edition was developed in the TraCES project and enriched with unique ids by Cristina Vertan, and was curated under the main responsibility of Andreas Ellwardt (for more details see Bausi, A. 2016. ‘Introduction. 150 Years After Dillmann’s Lexicon’, in A. Bausi and E. Sokolinski, eds, <i>150 Years after Dillmann’s Lexicon: Perspectives and Challenges of Gǝʿǝz Studies</i>, Supplement to Aethiopica, 5 (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2016), 6-7). The data is
        being processed within this application to improve the structure and the reusability of the
        large amount of information provided by this work. All parts of speech, abbreviations,
        citations, translations, notes, nesting of meaning, column breaks, internal references etc.
        have been marked up in TEI XML and the app relies on that markup as a structure.</p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
        <h4>Search</h4>
        <p>
            This search uses the exist-db Shakespeare demo app lucene functions, slightly modified. You can enter a string and select a mode or use standard Lucene special characters as in the info box.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Orthographic variants of the Ethiopic language are searched as a standard if not otherways
                specified. The following are the options considered by the search engine. Although the substitutions for transcription are of little relevance, since there are at the moment very few transcriptions

            <li>queries to Beta Maṣāḥǝft for related passages and text citations are also done with
                Jquery. Each citation in the format John 1.1 is linked in a popup to the exact
                passage if this is available in Beta Maṣāḥǝft, otherwise it is linked to the record
                of the edition </li>
