                <p>This app is built with exist-db, and uses Lucene as the standard search engine.
                    This comes with several options available. A full list is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html#Fuzzy Searches" target="_blank">here</a>

                </p>
                <h4>Input</h4>
                <p>If you want to transcribe some Fidal into Latin or update your transcription, you
                    can <a target="_blank" href="https://betamasaheft.github.io/transliteration/">have a go with our transcription tools</a>.</p>
                <p>If you are using the keyboard provided, please note that there are four layers,
                    the normal one and those activated by Shift, Alt, Alt+Shift.</p>
                <p>Normal and Shift contain mainly Fidal. Alt and Alt-Shift diacritics.</p>
                <p>To enter letters in Fidal and the diacritics with this keyboard, which is
                    independent of your local input selection, you can use two methods.</p>
                <h4>Keys Combinations</h4>
                <p>With this method you use keys combinations to trigger specific characters. <a target="_blank" href="/Dillmann/combos.html">Click here for a list of the
                        available combos.</a> This can be expanded<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Betamasaheft/Documentation/issues/new?labels=keyboard&amp;assignee=PietroLiuzzo&amp;body=Please%20add%20a%20combo%20in%20the%20input%20keyboard">, do not hesitate to ask (click here to post a new issue).</a>
                </p>
                <h4>Hold and choose</h4>
                <p>If you hold a key optional values will appear in a list. You can click on the
                    desired value or use arrows and enter to select it. The options are the same as
                    those activated by combinations.</p>
                <p>With this method you do not have to remember or lookup combos, but it does take
                    many more clicks...</p>

                    filters.</p>
                <p>You do not have to use all the parameters, set only those you are
                    interested in. You can also search for entries which don't contain a certain
                    information, using the corresponding switch . If this option is active you will
                    be selecting the ones you want to exclude instead of those you want to have.
                    Some examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting <em>masculinus</em> will return you all the lemmas which do
                        contain that. Selecting <em>femininus</em> and checking not will return you
                        all the lemmas which do not have that (so also verbs, for examples, adverbs,
                        etc.). If you want all the terms which do not contain text in Greek switch
                        not and tick Greek. </li>
                    <li>If you want all the entries which contain text in Syriac or in Coptic tick
                        Syriac and Coptic, which does not mean that you will not get entries which
                        have the other values as well as the ones you picked.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Modes</h4>
                <p>If you are searching a string, you might want to try one of the search modes.
                    Default method does not use any of those but uses the orthographic variants,
                    whereas if you do choose a mode, the variants will not be taken into
                    consideration and you will search only what you typed.</p>
                <h4>Search only in citations</h4>
                <p>Ticking this option will search only into <pre>ref</pre> elements in the TEI,
                    i.e. you are searching for citations of let's say Exodus. You tick this and
                    search "Ex." and you will get all places where this citation has been correctly
                    marked. There might be more because most of them have been tagged automatically
                    and there are known cases of mismatch or not matched.</p>
