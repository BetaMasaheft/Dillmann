                <p>This app is built with exist-db, and uses Lucene as the standard search engine.
                    This comes with several options available. A full list is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html#Fuzzy Searches" target="_blank">here</a>

                <h4>Input</h4>
                <p>If you want to transcribe some Fidal into Latin or update your transcription, you
                    can <a target="_blank" href="https://betamasaheft.github.io/transliteration/">have a go with our transcription tools</a>.</p>
                <p>If you are using the keyboard provided, please note that there are four layers,
                    the normal one and those activated by Shift, Alt, Alt+Shift.</p>
                <p>Normal and Shift contain mainly Fidal. Alt and Alt-Shift diacritics.</p>
                <p>To enter letters in Fidal and the diacritics with this keyboard, which is
                    independent of your local input selection, you can use two methods.</p>
                <h4>Keys Combinations</h4>
                <p>With this method you use keys combinations to trigger specific characters. <a target="_blank" href="/Dillmann/combos.html">Click here for a list of the
                        available combos.</a> This can be expanded<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Betamasaheft/Documentation/issues/new?labels=keyboard&amp;assignee=PietroLiuzzo&amp;body=Please%20add%20a%20combo%20in%20the%20input%20keyboard">, do not hesitate to ask (click here to post a new issue).</a>
                </p>
                <h4>Hold and choose</h4>
                <p>If you hold a key optional values will appear in a list. You can click on the
                    desired value or use arrows and enter to select it. The options are the same as
                    those activated by combinations.</p>
                <p>With this method you do not have to remember or lookup combos, but it does take
                    many more clicks...</p>

                <h4>Advanced options</h4>
                <p>Click on the plus button <i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"/> to get more
                    filters.</p>
                <p>You do not have to use all the parameters, set only those you are
                    interested in. You can also search for entries which don't contain a certain
                    information, using the corresponding switch . If this option is active you will
                    be selecting the ones you want to exclude instead of those you want to have.
                    Some examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting <em>masculinus</em> will return you all the lemmas which do
                        contain that. Selecting <em>femininus</em> and checking not will return you
                        all the lemmas which do not have that (so also verbs, for examples, adverbs,
                        etc.). If you want all the terms which do not contain text in Greek switch
                        not and tick Greek. </li>
                    <li>If you want all the entries which contain text in Syriac or in Coptic tick
                        Syriac and Coptic, which does not mean that you will not get entries which
                        have the other values as well as the ones you picked.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Modes</h4>
                <p>If you are searching a string, you might want to try one of the search modes.
                    Default method does not use any of those but uses the orthographic variants,
                    whereas if you do choose a mode, the variants will not be taken into
                    consideration and you will search only what you typed.</p>
                <h4>Search only in citations</h4>
                <p>Ticking this option will search only into <pre>ref</pre> elements in the TEI,
                    i.e. you are searching for citations of let's say Exodus. You tick this and
                    search "Ex." and you will get all places where this citation has been correctly
                    marked. There might be more because most of them have been tagged automatically
                    and there are known cases of mismatch or not matched.</p>

                <p>Every time you see a confirmation message the main editors of the Lexicon will
                    receive an email which looks like this. This allows a minimal level of control
                    on the edits.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6  alert alert-success">
                <p>You could simply paste some text inside your <pre>&lt;Sen&lt; some text as you want  &gt;S&gt;</pre>, but it is much more useful if it is a bit marked up.
                </p>
                <p>Here is a further example with a brief term added.</p>
                <p>Aas you can see in the image we have added here two meanings.</p>
                <p>To make the first we have clicked on NEW ENTRY button. We entered the lemma and changed the source to TraCES.</p>
                <p>We then changed <pre>&lt;Sen&lt;</pre> which was present by default
                    to <pre>&lt;Sde&lt;</pre>. and then we have added the translation and the graphic variant <pre>
                    &lt;Sde&lt;graphische Variante \*gez*ተውንያ፡\* &gt;de&gt;Tunica&gt; {ND} &gt;S&gt;</pre>
                </p>
                <p>The <pre>{ND}</pre> is a short notation for 'Not in Dillmann'. It should definitely stay there for any newly created entry. It is there by default, just be careful not to delete it.</p>
                <p>You then need to save the entry before you add a new meaning. In this case we wanted to add also an English meaning. </p>
                <p>On our new entry we clicked on update and then on Add new meaning, then we entered 'en'. The new text area appears with the <pre>&lt;Sen&lt; &gt;S&gt;</pre> already there, adn you can add more information. </p>
                <p>
                    <pre>
&lt;Sen&lt; graphic variant \*gez*ተውንያ፡\* &gt;en&gt;tunic&gt; [page,582a]bm:leslau1987dic &gt;S&gt;
                </pre>
                </p>
                <p>For this example we have added a bibliographic reference as in the example above.</p>
                <p>It would be better if there could be always at least:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transliteration</li>
                    <li>translation with a reference to the source</li>
                    <li>Part of speech (if different from those already in Dillmann)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the encoding process one important information from the Lexicon was lost,
                    namely the tick lines which group words under the same root. There is a plan to
                    include this information automatically, but until this happens, you can mark a
                    term as being the first in a group by clicking on update and then simply ticking
                    the box beside the lemma.</p>

                    <p>You cannot revert a change, but you can edit again and delete what you have

                    <p>If you want to remove an entire meaning there is a button to do so, but you
                        can also just carefully delete from the text.</p>
