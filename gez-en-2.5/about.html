                <p>An area of ancient written culture from the 1st millennium BCE, the Ethiopian
                    highlands have been home to a complex literary tradition (predominantly in
                    Ge'ez) that has no parallel in sub-Saharan Africa. Its emergence was determined
                    by Late Antique culture (Byzantium including Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and the
                    Red Sea), Mediterranean cultural encounters, and the African background. </p>
                <p> The earliest known texts were translations from Greek, later works were adopted
                    from Christian Arabic (esp. Copto-Arabic) literary tradition, in addition to a
                    rich local written production. The complexity of literary history is fully
                    reflected in the changes in grammar, lexicon and stylistic means of the Ge'ez
                    language.</p>

                <p>The project Beta maṣāḥǝft: Manuscripts of Ethiopia and Eritrea (Schriftkultur des
                    christlichen Äthiopiens: eine multimediale Forschungsumgebung) is a long-term
                    project funded within the framework of the Academies' Programme (coordinated by
                    the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities) under survey of
                    the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Hamburg. The funding will be provided for 25
                    years, from 2016–2040. The project is hosted by the Hiob Ludolf Centre for
                    Ethiopian Studies at the University of Hamburg. It aims at creating a virtual
                    research environment that shall manage complex data related to predominantly
                    Christian manuscript tradition of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Highlands.</p>

        <h2>About this application</h2>
        <p>This application, built in eXist-db uses basic tecniques to display data from the
            digitization process of the Lexicon Linguae Aethiopicae of Augustus Dillmann. It is
            deployed at the moment only for registered users with the relevant data at the
            University of Hamburg. </p>
        <h3>Preprocessing</h3> 
       <p> Heavy preprocessing of data has been carried out with regex in oxygen
        to encode the text starting from a txt version provided by Andreas Ellwardt. The data is
        being processed within this application to improve the structure and the reusability of the
        large amount of information provided by this work. all parts of speech, abbreviations,
        citations, translations, notes, nesting of meaning, column breaks, internal references etc.
        have been marked up in TEI XML and the app relies on that markup as a structure</p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
        <h4>Search</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>homophones of the ethiopic language are searched as a standard if not otherways
                specified. </li>
            <li>modes as per eXist-db sample app are also provided, with code from the demo
                application of eXist-db only slightly modified. </li>
            <li>It is possible to navigate by dillmann column</li>
            <li>with the plus button further features of the XML are usable to filter search results.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Xquery </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>the functions allow a group of editors to edit records with a simplified syntax in
                simple text, with no editor, with two XSLT transformations. The form contains also
                the guidelines for the editing of the intermediate text format.</li>
            <li>before submitting the new file this is validated against the schema. </li>
            <li>columns are computed from the data and linked to the pdf version available here
            </li>
            <li>the reverse index allows to navigate the data starting from translations or words in languages which are not latin</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Jquery</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>bibliography is pulled from Zotero EthioStudies group library </li>
            <li>queries to Beta Masaheft for related passages and text citations are also done with
                jquery. each citation in the format John 1.1 is linked in a popup to the exact
                passage if this is available in Beta Masaheft, otherwise it is linked to the record
                of the edition. </li>
