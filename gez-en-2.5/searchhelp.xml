                    <h3>Go To Column</h3>
                    <p>Use this to select the number of the column in the dillmann lexicon you wish to navigate to. It does not make a lot of sense to use this if you are searching a string.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h3>Search only in citations</h3>
                    <p>Ticking this option will search only into <pre>ref</pre> elements, i.e. you are searching for citations of lets say Exodus. You tick this and search "Ex." and you will get all places where this citation has been correctly marked. There might be more!</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Advanced options</h3>
                    <p>Click on the plus button to get more filters. You can check which one you want ONLY . You can also switch the not slider to select the ones you want to exclude instead of those you want to have. If you want all the terms which do not contain text in greek swich not and tick greek. If you want all the entries wich contain text in syriac or in coptic tick syriac and coptic, which does not mean you will not get entries which have the other valuess as well as the ones you picked.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Input</h3>
                    <p>If you want to transcribe some fidal into latin or update your transcription, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://betamasaheft.github.io/transliteration/">have a go with our transcription tools</a>.</p>
                    <p>If you are using the keyboard provided, please note that there are four layers, the normal one and those activated by Shift, Alt, Alt+Shift.</p>
                    <p>Normal and Shift contain mainly Fidal. Alt and Alt-Shift diacritics.</p>
                    <p>To enter letters in Fidal and the diacrics with this keyboard, which is independent of your local input selection, you can use two methods.</p>
                    <h4>Keys Combinations</h4>
                    <p>With this method you use keys combinations to trigger specific characters. 
                        <a target="_blank" href="/Dillmann/combos.html">Click here for a list of the available combos.</a> 
                        This can be expanded<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Betamasaheft/Documentation/issues/new?labels=keyboard&amp;assignee=PietroLiuzzo&amp;body=Please%20add%20a%20combo%20in%20the%20input%20keyboard">, do not hesitate to ask (click here to post a new issue).</a>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Hold and choose</h4>
                    <p>If you hold a key optional values will appear in a list. You can click on the desiderd value or use arrows and enter to select it. The options are the same as those activated by combinations.</p>
                    <p>With this method you do not have to remember or lookup combos, but it does take many more clicks...</p>
